## Synopsis

This is a project that allows the user to search any word or phrase. The software will then present the user with the top 10 Wikipedia entries for that word or phrase with links to those pages. Otherwise, the user can choose to click on some text that will take them to a random Wikipedia article in a new tab.

## Motivation

I completed this project to practice my coding skills and to complete the user stories specified in Free Code Camp.
