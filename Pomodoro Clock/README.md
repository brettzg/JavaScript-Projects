## Synopsis

This project allows the user to set a timer for a pomodoro clock. The user can set the session length and the break length. The clock will display the time remaining and "fill up" with a different color based on how much time is remaining. When the session finishes, the clock will let off a sound notifying the user, switch to break time, and begin to fill up with a different color. The clock can be paused at anytime by clicking within the clock.

## Motivation

I completed this project to practice my coding skills and to complete the user stories specified in Free Code Camp.
