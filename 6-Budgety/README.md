## Synopsis

This is a budget application that allows the user to add expenses and incomes. It displays the percentage of expenses in proportion to the income, and displays the total budget avaialble, total income, and total expenses. The individual incomes and expenses can be entered with a description and an amount. They will be displayed and can be removed below. The individual expenses will also display the percentage of the budget they remove.

NOTE: I only coded the JavaScript for this application.

## Motivation

I completed this project to practice my coding skills and to follow along with the content of "The Complete JavaScript Course", a course I took on Udemy.
