## Synopsis

This project is a weather application that shows the user their location, gives them a brief description of the weather in their area, and gives the speed and direction of wind in their area currently. It also shows the temperature and allows the user to switch between viewing the temperature in celsius and farenheit. Lastly, it changes the background picture based on the temperature.

Note: Does not work on my website because getCurrentPosition() is no longer supported in Chrome because my website is not HTTPS. If you download the code and host it locally through Brackets or another IDE, it should work.

## Motivation

I completed this project to practice my coding skills and to complete the user stories specified in Free Code Camp.
