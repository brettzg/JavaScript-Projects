## Synopsis

This project is a weather application that shows the user their location, gives them a brief description of the weather in their area, and gives the speed and direction of wind in their area currently. It also shows the temperature and allows the user to switch between viewing the temperature in celsius and farenheit. Lastly, it changes the background picture based on the temperature.

## Motivation

I completed this project to practice my coding skills, and completing the user stories specified in Free Code Camp.
