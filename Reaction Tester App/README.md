## Synopsis

This application will allow the user to test their reaction time. The app randomly chooses the time and location to display shapes on the screen within a range. When the user clicks on the shape, the app will show how long it took them to click the object.

## Motivation

I completed this project to practice my coding skills and to follow along with the tutorial presented in "The Complete Web Developer Course", a course I took on Udemy.
