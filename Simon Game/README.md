Synopsis

This project makes a playable version of the Simon Game as a web application. The goal is for the user to follow the random sequence of buttons that the game presents after each turn. The strict button will make the game restart at 1 color if the user makes a mistake. The game if the player successfully repeats the sequence at count 15.

Motivation

I completed this project to practice my coding skills, and completing the user stories specified in Free Code Camp.
