## Synopsis

This is a project that allows the user to view the status of a number of twitch streamers. The app will detect if the streamers are online or offline. The user can decide to view online, offline, or all streamers. The user can also view the icon of the streamer and click on their name to be taken to their twitch page. If online, the app will display the current activity of the streamer. 

## Motivation

I completed this project to practice my coding skills and to complete the user stories specified in Free Code Camp.
